# Sovol-SV06-firmware
### Fork from spinixguy's [work](https://github.com/spinixguy/Sovol-SV06-firmware)
This repository contains firmware for the SV06 3D printer from Sovol. You should not use this firmware on any other printer.

Use at your own risk. I am creating these files for my personal use and cannot be held responsible for what it might do to your printer.
